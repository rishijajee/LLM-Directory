## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment via GitHub (Recommended)

If your repository is connected to Vercel:

1. Push your changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Vercel will automatically detect the push and deploy your changes

3. Check deployment status at: https://vercel.com/dashboard

### Option 2: Deploy with Vercel CLI

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/rishi/claudeprojects/LLM-Directory

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Or just preview deployment
vercel
```

### Option 3: Manual Import to Vercel

1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import from GitHub: `rishijajee/LLM-Directory`
3. Vercel will auto-detect Vite and configure build settings
4. Click "Deploy"

## Build Configuration

The project is configured with `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite"
}
```

## Testing Your Deployment

Once deployed, test the new features:

1. âœ… Navigate to your Vercel URL
2. âœ… Scroll the table horizontally to see the new "Architecture" column
3. âœ… Click "View Details" on any model
4. âœ… Review the architecture modal with all component details
5. âœ… Test on mobile to ensure responsive design works
6. âœ… Press ESC or click outside to close the modal

## Architecture Data Included

Each model now has detailed architecture information including:

### Example (GPT-4):
- **Type**: Transformer-based Decoder
- **Layers**: ~96-120 transformer layers
- **Components**:
  - Core Architecture: Dense Transformer with MoE
  - Attention Mechanism: Multi-head self-attention
  - Reasoning Engine: Chain-of-thought reasoning
  - Vision Encoder: ViT for image processing
  - Safety Layer: RLHF alignment
  - Memory System: Context window management
  - Agent Capabilities: Function calling, tool use

All 16 models have similar detailed architecture breakdowns!

## Troubleshooting

If build fails:
```bash
# Clean install dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Test build locally
npm run build

# Test production build
npm run preview
```
