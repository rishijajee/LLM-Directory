# LLM Directory - Render Deployment Guide

Complete guide for deploying the LLM Directory application to Render.

## What is Render?

Render is a modern cloud platform that makes it easy to deploy and scale web applications, static sites, databases, and more. It offers:

- Free static site hosting with custom domains
- Automatic deployments from GitHub
- Built-in SSL certificates
- Global CDN for fast content delivery
- Pull request previews
- Zero configuration for many frameworks

## Prerequisites

Before deploying to Render, make sure you have:

1. A [Render account](https://render.com/) (free tier available)
2. Your code pushed to a GitHub repository
3. The `render.yaml` configuration file in your project root (‚úÖ already included)

## Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Blueprint Deployment (Recommended)

The easiest way to deploy using the included `render.yaml` configuration.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Sign in to Render**
   - Go to https://dashboard.render.com/
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

2. **Create New Blueprint**
   - Click the "New +" button in the top right
   - Select "Blueprint"

3. **Connect Repository**
   - Select "Connect a repository"
   - Choose your GitHub account
   - Find and select the `LLM-Directory` repository
   - Click "Connect"

4. **Review Configuration**
   - Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file
   - Review the service configuration:
     - **Service Name**: llm-directory
     - **Environment**: Static Site
     - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
     - **Publish Directory**: `./dist`

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Apply" to create the service
   - Render will start building your site
   - Wait for the build to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)

6. **Access Your Site**
   - Once deployed, you'll get a URL like: `https://llm-directory.onrender.com`
   - Your site is now live!

### Method 2: Manual Static Site Creation

Deploy without using the blueprint configuration.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Sign in to Render**
   - Go to https://dashboard.render.com/
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

2. **Create New Static Site**
   - Click "New +" ‚Üí "Static Site"

3. **Connect Repository**
   - Click "Connect a repository"
   - Choose your GitHub organization/account
   - Select the `LLM-Directory` repository
   - Click "Connect"

4. **Configure Build Settings**
   Fill in the following settings:

   - **Name**: `llm-directory` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Branch**: `main` (or your default branch)
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Publish Directory**: `dist`
   - **Auto-Deploy**: Yes (recommended)

5. **Advanced Settings (Optional)**

   Click "Advanced" to configure:
   - **Environment Variables**: Add any environment variables (none required for basic setup)
   - **Pull Request Previews**: Enable to get preview deployments for PRs

6. **Create Static Site**
   - Click "Create Static Site"
   - Render will start building your site
   - Wait for deployment to complete

7. **Access Your Site**
   - Your site will be available at: `https://[your-site-name].onrender.com`

    headers:
      - path: /*
        name: Cache-Control
        value: public, max-age=3600    # Cache static assets for 1 hour
    routes:
      - type: rewrite
        source: /*
        destination: /index.html       # SPA routing support
    envVars:
      - key: NODE_VERSION
        value: 18                      # Use Node.js 18
```

## Post-Deployment Setup

### Custom Domain

1. Go to your service dashboard on Render
2. Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Custom Domain"
3. Click "Add Custom Domain"
4. Enter your domain name
5. Follow the DNS configuration instructions
6. Render will automatically provision an SSL certificate

### Environment Variables

If you need to add environment variables:

1. Go to your service dashboard
2. Click "Environment"
3. Click "Add Environment Variable"
4. Enter key and value
5. Save changes
6. Render will redeploy automatically

### Monitoring

Monitor your deployment:

1. **Build Logs**: View real-time build output
2. **Deploy History**: See all past deployments
3. **Metrics**: Monitor bandwidth and request counts
4. **Events**: Track service events and changes

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Error: "Cannot find module '/opt/render/project/src/server.js'"

This error means Render is trying to run your app as a **Node.js Web Service** instead of a **Static Site**.

**Solution: Delete and recreate as Static Site**

1. **Delete the current service:**
   - Go to your Render Dashboard
   - Click on the service that's failing
   - Go to "Settings" (bottom of left sidebar)
   - Scroll down and click "Delete Service"
   - Confirm deletion

2. **Create a new Static Site (NOT Web Service):**
   - Go to https://dashboard.render.com/
   - Click "New +" ‚Üí **"Static Site"** (NOT "Web Service")
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Render should auto-detect the `render.yaml` configuration
   - Click "Create Static Site"

3. **If auto-detection fails, manually configure:**
   - **Build Command**: `npm ci && npm run build`
   - **Publish Directory**: `dist`
   - Leave **Start Command** empty (static sites don't need this)

**Why this happens:**
- Selecting "Web Service" tells Render to run a Node.js server
- Our app is a static React site that doesn't need a server
- Static sites serve pre-built HTML/CSS/JS files directly

### Build Fails

If your build fails:

1. **Check Build Logs**
   - Go to the "Events" tab
   - Click on the failed deployment
   - Review the build output

2. **Common Issues**:
   - **Missing dependencies**: Ensure `package.json` is up to date
   - **Node version**: Render uses Node 14 by default, we specify Node 18 in `render.yaml`
   - **Build command**: Verify the build command in settings

3. **Test Locally**:
   ```bash
   # Clean install
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install

   # Test build
   npm run build

   # Test preview
   npm run preview
   ```

### Site Not Loading

If your site deploys but doesn't load:

1. **Check Publish Directory**
   - Ensure it's set to `dist` (Vite's output directory)
   - Verify files exist in the `dist` folder after build

2. **Check Routes Configuration**
   - Ensure the rewrite rule is present for SPA support
   - All routes should redirect to `/index.html`

3. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Check network tab for failed requests

### Slow Build Times

If builds are taking too long:

1. **Review Dependencies**
   - Remove unused npm packages
   - Consider using a package cache

2. **Optimize Build**
   - Add `.node_modules` cache (Render does this automatically)
   - Ensure `npm ci` is used instead of `npm install` when possible

## Differences from Vercel

| Feature | Vercel | Render |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Serverless Functions** | ‚úÖ Supported in `/api` folder | ‚ùå Not for static sites |
| **Build Speed** | Very fast | Fast |
| **Free Bandwidth** | 100GB/month | 100GB/month |
| **Custom Domains** | ‚úÖ Unlimited | ‚úÖ Unlimited |
| **SSL Certificates** | ‚úÖ Automatic | ‚úÖ Automatic |
| **Pull Request Previews** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Configuration** | `vercel.json` | `render.yaml` |

### Important Note: API Functions

The `/api/notify-visit.js` serverless function is **Vercel-specific** and will not work on Render static sites.

**Options if you need API functionality on Render:**

1. **Use Vercel for APIs**: Deploy to both platforms - Render for static site, Vercel for APIs
2. **Deploy separate web service**: Create an Express.js backend on Render
3. **Use external services**: Replace serverless functions with third-party APIs

## Continuous Deployment

Once set up, your deployment workflow is automatic:

```bash
# Make changes to your code
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature"
git push origin main
```

Render will automatically:
1. Detect the push to GitHub
2. Pull the latest code
3. Run `npm install && npm run build`
4. Deploy the new version
5. Make it live within minutes
